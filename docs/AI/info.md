The main idea behind this implementation of an GGUF/LLM in the OASIS network is to enable distributed learning generated through the collective action of many individuals, with the goal of redistributing the necessary processing load, as well as the ecological footprint and corporate bias.

Our AI will be trained with content from the OASIS network and its purpose is to take action and obtain answers to individual, but also global, problems.

Future versions of the tuned model will be released as we improve model safety with community feedback.
